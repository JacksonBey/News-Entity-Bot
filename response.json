It also delivered a signature victory for the Texas GOP\u2019s ascendent conservative wing following a dramatic trial that put on display the fractures among Republicans nationally heading into 2024.More than three months after an overwhelming impeachment in the Texas House, which is controlled by Republicans, Paxton was just as convincingly acquitted by Senate Republicans who serve alongside his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton.'}"
